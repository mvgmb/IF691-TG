\subsubsection{Memory Usage}

Charts on Figures \ref{fig:persistent_client_app_memory}, \ref{fig:ephemeral_client_app_memory}, \ref{fig:persistent_server_app_memory}, and \ref{fig:ephemeral_server_app_memory} represent the memory usage of clients and servers during ephemeral and persistent experiments.

\subsubsection*{Overall Memory Usage}

These results were very similar to transport-layer experiments. \gls{http}/1 and \gls{http}/2 were the most memory efficient due to their simplicity and use of \gls{tcp} as transport protocol, which had similar results. \gls{http}/1+\gls{tls} and \gls{http}/2+\gls{tls} had increased memory usage due to \gls{tls} requirements for data encryption and \gls{tls} handshake. Finally, \gls{http}/3 had to use more memory due to QUIC’s overhead, which trades memory for efficiency.

\subsubsection*{HTTP/3 Unusual Ephemeral Client Memory Cost}

During ephemeral experiments, Go’s garbage collector also had problems dealing with the high rate of created clients, similar to QUIC's results during transport-layer experiments. Problem that begins worse with small payloads, but it gets amortized as data sizes gets larger, which results in slower responses from the server, allowing Go’s garbage collector time to do its job.
