\subsection{Ephemeral and Persistent Application Clients}

These experiments performs requests sequentially with application-layer protocols in two different ways. While the ephemeral experiment always creates a new client for each request, the persistent experiment creates only one client that performs all requests. Consequently, client creation and connection establishment overhead can be observed.
