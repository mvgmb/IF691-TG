\subsubsection{CPU Usage}

Charts on Figures \ref{fig:persistent_client_app_cpu}, \ref{fig:ephemeral_client_app_cpu}, \ref{fig:persistent_server_app_cpu}, and \ref{fig:ephemeral_server_app_cpu} represent the \gls{cpu} usage of clients and servers during ephemeral and persistent experiments.

\subsubsection*{Overall CPU Cost}

They follow a similar pattern to the latency and throughput results, \gls{http}/1 has the lowest \gls{cpu} usage, while \gls{http}/3 has the highest.

\gls{http}/3 is the worst since it has to deal with QUICâ€™s cryptography, sending and receiving of \gls{udp} packets, and maintaining internal QUIC state. \gls{http}/2+\gls{tls} and \gls{http}/1+\gls{tls} is better than \gls{http}/3, since they perform better in a reliable network, as stated before. Finally, \gls{http}/1 and \gls{http}/2 are the most performing since they do not have to deal with data encryption and \gls{tls}  handshake overhead.

\subsubsection*{Servers CPU Cost}

Servers \gls{cpu} usage were usually mirrored with its clients. This can be explained by the fact that the server response has the same size as the client request, resulting in the same usage of \gls{cpu} since they have to perform the same operations to be able to send data.
