\section{Parallel and Sequential Clients Experiments}

As experiments were described in the \textit{Experiments} section, this section contains all results regarding sequential persistent and parallel persistent clients, referred, respectively, as sequential and parallel clients.

It's divided into two subsections: transport-layer protocols and application-layer protocols. Each subsection is divided into three subsections: Latency \& Throughput, CPU Usage, and Memory Usage. Consequently, all metrics collected are analysed.

\subsection{Summary}

This section explained the results obtained from parallel and sequential clients. It showed how each protocol performed when having to perform multiple requests at the same time with a persistent client. Thus, each protocol concurrent optimization is exposed.
