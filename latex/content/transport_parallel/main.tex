\subsection{Parallel and Sequential Transport Clients}

All previous transport-layer protocols experiments performed requests sequentially, undermining the possible gain in efficiency of protocols that contain improvements to performing concurrent requests. Therefore, these experiments tries to explore this scenario by performing all 10000 requests within 100 goroutines.
